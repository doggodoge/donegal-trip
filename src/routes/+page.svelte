    This is a cycling trip from Castlerock, Co. Derry to Malin Head in the
    Inishowen Peninsula, Co. Donegal. There's a few things that needed planned
    out in a bit more detail, so made this website to compile the info I've got
    so far. Click on the links at the top, I'll keep this updated when anything
    changes.
